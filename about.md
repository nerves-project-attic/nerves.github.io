Write your firmware using Erlang/OTP and popular Erlang build tools like Rebar and Relx in a cross-compiled environment for targeting small to medium sized embedded devices. Releases are packaged into bootable all-in-one firmware images. Buildroot provides the base images and simplifies cross-compilation of external C/C++ libraries needed for your application.
